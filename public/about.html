  I took my primary school at Cebu City YLAC Free School, a Catholic school, from year 2004 to 2010.
  I had my Secondary Education at Don Bosco Technology Center - Cebu, an all-boys Catholic school, from 2010 to 2014.
  I then took my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering at Cebu Institute of Technology - University, from 2014 to 2019.
  I got my License in Electronics Technician in 2021 and my License in Electronics Engineer in 2022.

<p>During my college life, I met the love of my life, my inspiration, and one of the many people who pushes me to the limit,
  who always believes in me, Klaire Diane Abainza. By the way, she is also a Licenesed Electronics Engineer and a Licensed
  Electronics Technician. In fact, we achieved both licenses together. We have been together for 8 strong years already hehehehe.

  In Febuary 2021 to September 2021, I worked as an Radio Frequency(RF) Engineer in JXM Technologies Inc. for 6 months only, as I have to take 
  the April 2022 E lectronics Engineer Licensure examination. And in March 2023 to September 2023, I worked as a Site Implementor/Surveyor at 
  ADCEM Teleconstruct Corp.

  My love and passion in computer and technology drove me to career shift from being a telecommunications engineer to becoming 
  a software engineer. I am currently learning Javascript on how to build a website and add it to my portfolio and hopefully to be hired as a 
  software engineer.
